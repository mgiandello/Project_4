# Final Project

### Team: Paramount Predictors
### Members: Michaela Giandello and Rebecca Melo

## [Product](add html to heroku here)

This repo houses a [website](add html to heroku here) that visualizes and predicts the revenue and IMDb ratings of upcoming films based on historical movie releases from 1980 to 20202. 

### The Data

The team gathered data from Kaggle, IMDB, OMDB, and The Numbers. The information obtained included movie budget data, upcoming movies, genres, actors, etc.
The collected data was then cleaned and saved to csv files and the database was created.
PostgreSQL was used to host the database.

### The Model

Our team created 3 Jupyter Notebook files containing the our machine learning models for Random Forest Classifer and Logstic Regression. Both models were used to predict box office success and IMDb ratings based on the historical movie data.

### The Webpage

Heroku was used to host this application. It references this repository's root directory to build a public application.

## Process

### Project Proposal

The goal of this project was to create a website containing a model to predict a films box office success and IMDb ratings, based on the historical movie data the team gathered.

### Website Scraping
Example of code used to scrape from one of the data sources is shown below.

We used the available data we had from web scrapping IMDb to pull the recent 2021 and 2022 missing data from our orginal Kaggle data set.
Then, we scraped the IMDb website for upcming movie lists, to then save that list and search through our API.
