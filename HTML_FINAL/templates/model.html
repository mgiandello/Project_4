                                Big-budget movies carry a large financial risk. In order to help make decisions on a release strategy, we started
                                an application to predict the box office success and IMDb ratings of a film.<br>
                                We gathered data on historical movie releases from the past 42 years to create an algorithm and predict a range
                                of box office earnings for future debuts.<br>
                                <br>
                                Unfortunelty, we are still in our model is still in Beta testing.

                            <p>
                                We followed a traditional extract, transform, and load process to create a database hosted on Heroku. 
                                The data we collected includes budget, runtime, genres, directors, actors, meta-scores, IMDb ratings, and
                                more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We gathered data regarding releases over the past 42 years (1980-present) as we wanted to collect the most data possible that was avaioble to us.
                                The target movies was determined to be upcoming films releasing over the next several months in 2022.

                                Movie titles and budget data was gathered from thenumbers.com<br>
                                The majority of historical data was called from the OMDb API and Kaggle.<br>
                                The data on upcoming movies was gathered from IMDb.<br>
                                Web scrapers were used to gather non-API data.

                                Data was cleaned using Jupyter notebook scripts.<br>
                                All of the data gathered from OMDb was stored as objects, so all datatypes were converted appropriately to load
                                into the database.<br>
                                Movie titles for the upcoming released films scraped from IMDb included year of release in the string. This
                                attribute was removed via string split.<br>
                                Omitted data included: language, plot, and country (We kept to top Domestic Films only).<br>
                                Release date information was converted to Month.<br>
                                Features gathered from separate sources were all merged to a single dataframe on the movie title.<br>

                                connecting to PostgreSQL. <br>
                                pgAdmin was our preferred way of storing our data locally.

                                We used the available data we had from web scrapping and Kaggle, but our models were not accurate with the amount of features we had.
                                Important features like a movie's budget, which would be helpful to predict the Box Office outcomes, is mostly data is behind a ignificant paywall. 
                                Therefore, this has lead to an issue in trying to predict Box Office and IMDb ratings. More features are needed to make our accuarcy better.

                            <p>
                                As we moved into the data cleaning portion of the project, the shape of our data began to change. We encountered
                                noisy, inconsistent, and missing data. For these reasons we elected to not include the ceratin features like language, plot, and country.
                                After dropping irrelevant columns, changing the release date to a month column, creating dummy columns for genre and movie rating, 
                                and scaling the data, we were ready to test out some models.

                            <p>
                                Initially, we tried multiple models and target data binning methods to see which ones would yield the best
                                result. Linear regression and SVM models didn’t seem suitable for the dataset that we assembled, so we moved
                                on to random forests, and logstic regression. These 2 models yielded different accuracy scores: 
                                <br>

                                <br>
                                These testing scores are very low, in which predicting the Box Office revenue was very inaccurate from Prediction 
                                vs. Actual just on the Histroical Movie Data alone. This is when we decided Random Forest was not the best choice.

                                revenue was still inaccurate from Prediction vs. Actual on Historical Move Data and Upcoming Movie Data.
